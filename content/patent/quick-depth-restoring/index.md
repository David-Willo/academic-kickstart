abstract: "The invention relates to the technical field of stereo vision in computer vision, and particularly to a depth restoring method for three-dimensional reconstruction. After depths of sparse characteristic points in an image are obtained through a structure from motion (SFM), depth is diffused based on the sparse characteristic points and a gray scale image through multilayer down-sampling and a double-side filter. An accurate depth map is quickly restored from low resolution to high resolution and from rough to fine in a layered manner. The method has advantages of accurate result and low calculating amount. The sparse characteristic points which are obtained through calculation in the system can be restored to the dense depth map by means of a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system based on a characteristic point method, thereby reconstructing the three-dimensional dense map."
