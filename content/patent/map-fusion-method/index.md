abstract: "The invention relates to the technical field of map fusion, in particular to a map fusion method suitable for a sub-map with few overlapping parts. The method comprises: firstly, iteratively calculating a rotation matrix R by using point cloud plane extraction, normal vector estimation and normal vector projection angle statistics methods, then iteratively transforming source point clouds by usingthe R, finally, performing three-view projection on the two groups of point clouds to obtain two groups of grey-scale maps, and calculating a translation vector t by using a phase correlation methodfor the grey-scale maps; and finally obtaining a transformation matrix (R, t) between the two groups of point clouds. According to the map fusion method suitable for a sub-map with few overlapping parts, the fusion of the sub-maps under the low overlapping degree can be correctly completed, the error of searching corresponding points by the previous methods is avoided, and the method is suitable for the registration between two groups of large map point clouds with fewer overlapping parts and three axes having rotating angles at the same time."
