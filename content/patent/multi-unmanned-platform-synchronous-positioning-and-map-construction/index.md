abstract: " The invention relates to a multi-unmanned-platform synchronous positioning and map construction method under limitation of communication bandwidth and distance. The method comprises: constructing a plurality of unmanned platform systems with ArUco tags and carrying out own-side target detection and own-side target relative attitude estimation by using a visual system; on the basis of a hand-eye calibration method, carrying out conversion into a relative pose under a visual system coordinate system and converting the relative pose into a radar coordinate system by using external parameters calibrated by a camera and a radar; carrying out communication only between unmanned systems generating a closed loop after detection of the own-side target and carrying out joint pose map construction and optimization by an active loopback unmanned system terminal; optimizing the pose at an active loopback terminal to realize expression of poses of different robots under the same coordinate system, acquiring an accurate pose, and then sending the accurate pose to an active loopback unmanned platform; and after recycling of the unmanned systems, transmitting all independent unmanned system maps tothe central platform and carrying out fusion. Therefore, a cooperative SLAM problem under limitation of the communication distance and communication limitation is solved."
