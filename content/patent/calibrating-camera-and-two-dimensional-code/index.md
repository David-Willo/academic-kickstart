#abstract: " The invention relates to a method for calibrating a camera and a two-dimensional code in an unmanned vehicle. The method comprises the following steps of: S1, constructing the unmanned vehicle, carrying the camera and the two-dimensional code, and installing a plurality of special mark points for an optirack capture system around the camera and the two-dimensional code; S2, acquiring a pose of a rigid body constructed by means of the plurality of mark points around the two-dimensional code in the unmanned vehicle in a scene and a pose of a rigid body constructed by means of the plurality of mark points around the camera in the unmanned vehicle by using the optirack capture system; S3, recognizing the two-dimensional code in the unmanned vehicle through utilizing the camera in the scene, and acquiring a pose of the two-dimensional code in a coordinate system of the camera in the scene; S4, acquiring a pose of the center position of the two-dimensional code in the scene under the cameracoordinate system by means of the camera in the unmanned vehicle; S5, calculating a relative pose between the two-dimensional code in the unmanned vehicle and the rigid body constructed by means of the plurality of mark points around the two-dimensional code, and a relative pose between the camera and the rigid body constructed by means of the plurality of mark points around the camera; S6, and calculating a relative pose between the camera and the two-dimensional code in the unmanned vehicle by using the existing data to obtain a calibration result. The method provides a high-precision calibration result."
